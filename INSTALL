Dependencies
============

Required libraries:
- libexpat
- libsqlite3 (for sqliteimport)
- libpqxx (for pgimport)

Libraries are needed to run the programs. Additionally their development
headers to build them. For compilation also a C++ compiler is necessary.


Build
=====

Build with `cmake`, `scons` or plain `make`.

The CMake build compiles `sqliteimport` and `pgimport` only if the necesary libraries/header
can be found and skips them otherwise.

Build all with scons:
  $ scons

Build just one target:
  $ scons sqliteimport

Optionally you can also build with make.
Build all:
  $ make

Build just one target:
  $ make sqliteimport


Install
=======

Manually copy the resulting binaries to whereever you would like to have them
installed.
